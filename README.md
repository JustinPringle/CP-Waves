# CP-Waves
A repository to develop open source code

## Description
The repository consists of three components.

1. Classisfaction:
	* 	synoptic scale classification and optimization code.
	*  Fortran based code.
	*  iPython notebook containing Pseudo code.
2. Shoreline:
	* Cross shore one-line model based on: Jara, M., Gonzalez, M., Medina, R., 2015. Shoreline evolution model from a dynamic equilibrium beach profile. Coastal Engineering 99, 1â€“14. 
	* python 3.7.3 code.
3. Waves:
	*  Wave simulation code to stochastically simulate waves based on synoptic scale circulation patterns.
	*  python 3.7.3 code
